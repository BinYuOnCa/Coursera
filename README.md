**Peer-graded Assignment: The best classifier**

In this project, you will complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

You load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

-   k-Nearest Neighbour
-   Decision Tree
-   Support Vector Machine
-   Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

-   Jaccard index
-   F1-score
-   LogLoass
